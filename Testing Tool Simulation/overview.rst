This page is an overview of the intended analysis of 'DiagnosticTool.' The goal of the analysis is to evaluate the
value of different testing tools with regards to post-maket surveillance (PMS) in a supply-chain context.
The question we investigate is "Under what environments does it make sense to choose one testing tool over another?"
Environments have characteristics including budgetary limits, supply-chain structures, and the prevalence of SFPs.




The efficacy of different testing tools is measured through four metrics, detailed as follows:

* Interval scoring: What proportion of true node SFP rates fall within the credible intervals formed under different testing tools?
* Gneiting scoring: What are the interval scores, penalized for distance if the true rate is missed, for the credible intervals formed under different testing tools?
* Suspect accuracy: What are the Type I and Type II error rates for each testing tool with respect to suspecting nodes with SFP rates above the suspect threshold, t?
* Exoneration accuracy: What are the Type I and Type II error rates for each testing tool with respect to exonerating nodes with SFP rates below the exoneration threshold, u?
